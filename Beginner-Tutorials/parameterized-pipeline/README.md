# Parameterized Deployment Pipeline (Jenkins)

This Jenkins pipeline demonstrates how to build and deploy an application based on user-defined parameters.

## Features:
- Accepts parameters: **User Name, Environment (DEV/QA/PROD), Debug Mode**
- Simulates **Build → Deployment → Post-Deployment Checks**
- Requires **Approval for PROD deployment** (real-world scenario)
- Uses a **dynamic deployment path**
